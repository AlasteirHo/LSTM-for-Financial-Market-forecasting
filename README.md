Introduction
Stock price prediction is critical for developing investment strategies and managing risks. Traditional regression models fall short in capturing the non-linear and sequential dependencies inherent in stock price data. This project employs LSTM neural networks to overcome these limitations and achieve robust prediction accuracy.

Key results:

R² Score: 0.92
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 9.89
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 1.02%
Features
Predicts stock prices using historical closing prices.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization.
Forecasts up to 5 trading days into the future.
Provides insights into the benefits and limitations of LSTM models in financial forecasting.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
yfinance
Dataset
The dataset comprises 4 years of daily closing prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL), obtained using the yfinance library. The data was preprocessed by:

Normalizing values using MinMaxScaler.
Splitting into training and validation sets (80:20 ratio).
Using a sliding-window approach for sequence preparation.
Model Architecture
The model consists of:

Two LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.
Dense layers for output predictions.
Optimized using the Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
Hyperparameters were fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization, resulting in improved model performance.

Performance
The model achieved high accuracy and effectively captured trends:

Validation R² Score: 0.92
Validation MAPE: 1.02%
Predicted vs. actual values closely aligned, showcasing minimal overfitting.
